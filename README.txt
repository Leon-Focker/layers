Layers is a generative music library for slippery chicken and pure data

Slippery chicken should already be up and running in order to use this library. 
Then load either the src/layers.lsp file to get all functionality or a score file to start making music :P

If anyone ever uses his and there is any questions contact me at Leon.Focker@t-online.de
