Layers is a generative music library for slippery chicken and pure data

Slippery chicken should already be up and running in order to use this library. 
Then load either the src/all.lsp file to get all functionality and check score/test.lsp to see how to use it.
Use (start-osc) to connect to osc (lisp and pure data need to speak to each other for real-time use)

If anyone ever uses this and there is any questions contact me at Leon.Focker@t-online.de
